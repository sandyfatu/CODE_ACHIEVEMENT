1. I created a folder named code_achievement inside my workdirectory and created this file as a vs file.

2. I echo in My process and checked my file is created with the ls command.
3. I made necessary corrections on my file with vi and change dir to my work directory for vs cloning.
*Note-I cat to check for effective-work.
4. I cloned my github repo and add, but got an error code.
